I'm just a lil' c++ coder who wants to explore rust for the first time.
In this repo, I write games in c++ and then rewrite them in rust, trying to be as idiomatically correct as I can.
Please give critique if you know what you're talking about so that both the rust and c++ versions can be exemplary.
